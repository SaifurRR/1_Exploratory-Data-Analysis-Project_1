# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 1. HuggingFace_PolynomialRoots_EDA

  - Reason for dataset selection :
    I have selected the ''math_datasets' from the available datasets in Hugging Face. This dataset code generates mathematical question and answer pairs, from a range of 
    question types at roughly school-level difficulty. This is designed to test the mathematical learning and algebraic reasoning skills of learning models. There are in
    total 4434 mathematical functions available in the dataset. From the long list of functions, I chose 'Algebraic Polynomial Roots', as my mathematical function. The 
    dataset comprises of 'train-set' & 'test-set', which have 'question' & 'answer' column. 
    
 -  Process to use the repository:
    A note-book is included in the repository. All the steps of EDA are mentioned as Markdown in the ipynb notebook. This ipynb Notebook was 
    created in Jupyter Notebook and tested in Visual Studio Code in Python 3.9.7 version.
